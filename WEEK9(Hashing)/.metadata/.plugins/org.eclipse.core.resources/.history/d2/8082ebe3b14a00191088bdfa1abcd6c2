Sorting Algorithm Analysis (1 point)

Student Name: Jiweon Park

1. Explain which algorithms have the best performance. Why are there differences in times? 
	Recursive Sort has the best performance.
	Each sorting calls different methods. 
	In selection sort, for example, it has two methods, calling finding the smallest number index and swap.
	Depending on how many calls does a the sort function have, times are different. 
	For the recursive sort, the implementation take O(n^2) time.


2. The sorting utility methods use the list interface methods. How does this affect the performance of each sorting algorithm?
   What would you do to improve the performance of the sorting methods?
   
   
   

3. Add the output from one of your test runs here (use cut and paste)
