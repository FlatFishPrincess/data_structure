Sorting Algorithm Analysis (1 point)

Student Name: Jiweon Park

1. Explain which algorithms have the best performance. Why are there differences in times? 





2. The sorting utility methods use the list interface methods. How does this affect the performance of each sorting algorithm?
   What would you do to improve the performance of the sorting methods?
   
   
   

   
3. Add the output from one of your test runs here (use cut and paste)
